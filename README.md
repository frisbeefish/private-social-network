# private-social-network

This is an implementation of a WordPress-like private social network builder. You can create your own private social network with the click of a button.

NOTE: This is a work in progress. I'm re-implementing this in node.js. The currently running version is written in Python/Flask.

Here are some screen shots that show how the final product looks:
